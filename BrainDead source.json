      "subtitle": "The universal TrollStore installer for iOS 14.0 - 17.0.0.0 beta 4",
      "localizedDescription": "Overview\n\nTrollInstallerX is a universal TrollStore installer. It focuses on being extremely reliable and easy to use. It is also very fast, being able to install TrollStore and/or its persistence helper in a matter of seconds on the latest devices.\n\nTrollInstallerX supports all devices running iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1, both arm64 and arm64e. It makes use of one of two different methods to install TrollStore, depending on what device and iOS you have. These methods are:\n\n• Direct installation: using the kfd kernel exploit, along with the dmaFail PPL bypass on iOS 15.2+ arm64e devices, TrollInstallerX can install both TrollStore and its persistence helper directly onto the device without having to leave the installer.\n\n   - Supports iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64) and iOS 14.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e).\n      • Note: A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1 do not support this method.\n      • Note: A8 devices are only supported on iOS 14.0 - 15.1 for the time being.\n• Indirect installation: Using the kfd kernel exploit, TrollInstallerX can replace a system application of your choice with the TrollStore persistence helper. This method only exists due to both the lack of a PPL bypass on iOS 16.6 and above, as well as the fact that dmaFail is non-functional on A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.\n\n   - Supports iOS 16.5.1 - 16.6.1 (arm64e).\n      • Note: This method is the only method that supports A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.\n\nBoth methods allow you to install a persistence helper into a removable system app. The reason that this is needed is due to the way that the CoreTrust bug (used by TrollStore) works - in certain circumstances, TrollStore and other apps installed by it will be reset to User registration, instead of System. You cannot open any of these apps until you have used the persistence helper to set them back to System registration.\n\n\nUsage\n\nTrollInstallerX is extremely easy to use. Simply download the latest release from the Releases page, and sideload it using your preferred method. Once installed, open the app and press the \"Install\" button. From there, TrollStore and/or its persistence helper will be installed onto your device.\n\nTrollInstallerX will automatically choose the best exploit for your device. However, in some cases, you may want to choose a specific exploit. To do this, simply open the settings view and select the exploit that you want to use. Once you have selected it, press the \"Install TrollStore\" button and TrollInstallerX will use the exploit you have chosen.\n\nNote: iOS 16.2 - 16.6.1 and iOS 15.7.2 - 15.8.2 require an internet connection in order for TrollInstallerX to download the kernelcache and patchfind it.",

      "localizedDescription": "PPSSPP is the best and only PSP emulator for iOS written in C++. It is capable of running a lot of original games but, depending on the power of your device, not all may run at full speed due to restrictions on non-jailbroken devices.\n\nThe app was originally created by Henrik Rydgård in November 2012; however, iOS builds are mostly managed by talented developer, Karen Tsai (aka @angelxwind) and a large group of contributors that submit issue reports and fixes. Several versions of PPSSPP can be played on numerous devices such as Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and Blackberry 10. The iOS version can be found on both Jailbreak and non-Jailbreak devices.\n\nPPSSPP supports all versions of iPad, iPhone, iPod touch running iOS 5 and above; this includes iPhone 5 and other retina-enabled devices. The emulator does not require bios to play, PPSSPP is - in many ways - a “HLE” emulator. PPSSPP requires ROM images, specifically .ISO or .CSO files, to play. No ROMs are included in this copy of the emulator. If you own any games, add them through iTunes Sharing or other programs like 'iExplorer.' Keep in mind these files are extremely big, sometimes taking several gigs in size.\n\nThe emulator is built to use JIT decompilers (dynarecs) which can only be accessed on a jailbroken device due to the codesigining requirement. Therefore, most games will run very slow on non-jailbroken devices; however, there are a few older PSP games that will run just fine and up to speed depending on your iOS device.",

As well as a number of tweaks to customise the UI and improve the overall user experience.\n\nHere are the following tweaks:\n\n• Spotilife - Premium for free.\n\n• Sposify - A Tweak to customize your Spotify App UI and expand functionalities.\n\n• Volify - Adds a volume slider to Spotify.\n\n• SpotifyAllowSetting - Allows you to access all of the settings in Spotify that are normally disabled when someone else is playing music from another device.\n\n• SpotifyNoPodcasts - Hides Podcasts from from Home and Library\n\n• SpotifyHighQuality - Enables 'Very High' Quality in Audio Quality settings\n\n•TrueShuffle - Enables true random shuffling (Spotify prioritizes Songs you have listened to more often by default)\n\n• Spoticentre - Centres the song/artist in now playing (Only working on some devices)\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\nThe ‘Car’ setting has been replaced with the sposify tweak settings so unfortunatley you cannot change car settings - all good tho, nobody use that shi anyways, and when car view enables when u in the car, just click ‘turn off car view’ at the top right corner.\n\n\nAll tweaks are injected by myself, WuXu, and ensured to be working perfectly ;)\n",
